      <h1>Writing LTI Stuff</h1>
      
      <p>
        This page goes over the basics of creating an app that leverages LTI. There's
        a lot of great links at the bottom that may help out, but it's probably a good
        idea to at least read the intro first to get a feel for what LTI does exactly.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <div class="thumbnail" style="float: right; width: 300px; margin-left: 10px;">

            <p>Identity assertion is a one-way "handshake" coming from the learning platform (consumer) to the app (provider).</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The main thing with LTI is the identity assertion. LTI is a way for 
            one system (the tool <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span>, typically an LMS) 
            to send a user to 
            another system (the tool <span class='label label-info'>provider</span>, 
            some service that integrates with
            the LMS -- sorry, I know the names are confusing. I've tried using colors to
            help make things clearer, but that may just make it worse...) in a trusted way. The most
            common reason for the trust assertion is to allow the user to be automatically
            signed in and directed to a specific course or module when 
            the <span class='label label-info'>provider</span> renders content.
          </p>
          <div class="thumbnail" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin-right: 20px;">
            <img src="/coding/tool_iframe.png" alt=""/>
            <p>Tools (providers) are launched from within the learning platform (consumer) in an iframe so they feel like a native part of the platform.</p>
          </div>
          <p>
            The
            <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span> and 
            <span class='label label-info'>provider</span> 
            have some predefined relationship via a consumer key and shared
            secret that are used to sign any messages passed between systems. All messages
            are <a href='http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/example/signature.html'>signed with an OAuth signature</a>
            that can be verified by either party. For the most part information only travels one
            way, from the <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span> to the
            <span class='label label-info'>provider</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The identity assertion happens through
            an HTTP POST request from the <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span> to the
            <span class='label label-info'>provider</span>. The POST request must happen
            in the user's browser, which means it needs to be 
            launched by submitting a form. Most of the time the form is submitted via
            JavaScript to an iframe rendered on a page within the <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span>, 
            so the user doesn't have an extra step when trying to launch
            an app.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="#params">Below are a list of parameters</a> that can be sent as part of the POST
            request. Some are required, some are optional. Most apps shouldn't need more
            than the first set of parameters and can probably just ignore the rest.

          <h2>Building an LTI App</h2>
          <p>If you want to build an LTI-compliant app or <span class='label label-info'>provider</span>
          then there's really only a couple things you need to worry about: how users can
          configure your app, how to accept a launch from a <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span>,
          and potentially handling some of the extra goodies LTI makes possible.</p>
          
          <h3>App Configuration</h3>
          <p>App configuration is <a href="/tutorials.html">different for every LMS</a> right
          now, but we're working on that. The best way to provide a standard configuration
          for your app is by providing a url that returns an xml configuration for your
          app. There's a lot of 
          <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/tools_xml.html">examples of app 
          configurations in the Canvas API documentation</a>. Remember, if there's custom
          values you want to make sure come across with every user, this is the place
          to include them. The only really crucial piece to specify is the url endpoint that will
          accept the POST requests, <code>blti:launch_url</code>.</p>
          <p>Typically users will either copy the url to your xml configuration, or copy
          and paste the configuration itself.
          Notice that the configuration does not include the consumer key or shared
          secret. These are account-specific values, and if they were included they'd prevent
          the xml from being reusable. Admins will still have to enter the key and
          secret values that a <span class='label label-info'>provider</span> gives them
          into the <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span> manually.</p>
          
          <h3>App Launch</h3>
          <p>Once an app is configured, it will be added by one or more instructors into
          their material as some sort of link or button in the <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span>.
          Any time a student, instructor, administrator, or random internet passersby clicks
          the link they will be directed to the <span class='label label-info'>provider</span>
          via a signed POST request. It is the <span class='label label-info'>provider's</span> 
          responsibility to confirm the signature on the POST request. If the signature is
          invalid then none of the information should be trusted.</p>
          <p>If the signature is 
          valid then you should accept the identity assertion provided by the <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span>
          and log the user in to your service. Many services have their own registration flow,
          so it's not uncommon to require an additional registration step the first
          time a user launches your app.</p>
          <p>Signatures are generated using <a href="http://oauth.net/core/1.0/#signing_process">the OAuth signing process</a>.
          Google provides <a href="http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/javascript/example/signature.html">a nice tool for generating OAuth signatures</a>
          that you can use to test your signing code, although you'll probably save yourself
          some trouble if you can find a library to do the work for you.</p>
          
          <h3>Extras</h3>
          <p>This page has described the most basic type of LTI integration. There's a number of
          other things you can do on top of this, including passing scores from the
          <span class='label label-info'>provider</span> back to the gradebook of the
          </span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span>, or adding buttons to the 
          rich editor in the <span class='label label-warning'>consumer</span> to insert
          rich content generated or curated by the <span class='label label-info'>provider</span>.
          <a href="/extensions">Check out the extensions demos page</a> or the 
          <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/tools_intro.html">Canvas API documentation on external tools</a>
          for more detail on these extensions and how they work.

                to the same class, each placement would send a different id, and
                should be considered a unique "launch". For example, if the
